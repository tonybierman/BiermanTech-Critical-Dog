    <h1 class="display-4">Welcome to Critical Dog</h1>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Critical Dog is a comprehensive application designed for managing and analyzing detailed canine health, behavior, and environmental data. It provides a robust platform for tracking and recording various metrics related to canine biology, veterinary care, nutrition, and behavior, catering to veterinarians, breeders, researchers, and dog owners. Built with a focus on standardized data collection, Critical Dog supports scientific disciplines such as canine biology, veterinary medicine, nutrition science, ethology, and pharmacology.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>The Critical Dog application aims to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Facilitate precise tracking of canine health metrics, such as weight, heart rate, and temperature.</li>
        <li>Monitor behavioral patterns, reproductive cycles, and environmental conditions.</li>
        <li>Support nutritional analysis and dietary management for optimal canine health.</li>
        <li>Provide a structured framework for recording and analyzing data across multiple scientific disciplines.</li>
        <li>Enable users to make data-driven decisions for canine care, breeding, and research.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Features</h2>
    <p>Critical Dog offers a rich set of features to support canine data management:</p>

    <h3>Health and Vital Signs Tracking</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Record quantitative metrics like weight, heart rate, respiratory rate, body temperature, and hydration levels.</li>
        <li>Support for multiple units (e.g., kilograms, pounds, Celsius, Fahrenheit, beats per minute).</li>
        <li>Semi-quantitative scoring for metrics like pain assessment, coat condition, and dental health (e.g., 1–10 pain scale, 1–5 coat condition score).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Behavioral Observations</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Capture qualitative notes on behavior, socialization, and training progress.</li>
        <li>Track training command mastery with semi-quantitative scores (e.g., 1–5 scale).</li>
        <li>Monitor behavioral traits relevant to ethology studies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Reproductive and Genetic Data</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Track reproductive metrics such as litter size, gestation progress, and estrus cycle stages.</li>
        <li>Record genetic data, including mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), Y-chromosome DNA (Y-DNA), and health condition statuses.</li>
        <li>Support for Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) hip grading and other anatomical evaluations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Nutritional Management</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Monitor dietary intake, including daily caloric intake and appetite levels.</li>
        <li>Assess stool quality using a standardized 1–7 scale.</li>
        <li>Track life stage factors to tailor nutritional needs for puppies, adults, and seniors.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Environmental Monitoring</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Record environmental conditions like ambient humidity and kennel space (e.g., square meters).</li>
        <li>Support for qualitative and quantitative environmental observations to ensure optimal living conditions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Scientific Discipline Integration</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Align data collection with disciplines such as:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Canine Biology</strong>: Anatomy, physiology, and genetics.</li>
                <li><strong>Veterinary Medicine</strong>: Diagnosis, treatment, and vital signs.</li>
                <li><strong>Nutrition Science</strong>: Dietary needs and energy intake.</li>
                <li><strong>Ethology</strong>: Behavioral studies.</li>
                <li><strong>Pharmacology</strong>: Medication administration and effects.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Link observations to relevant disciplines for research and analysis.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Standardized Data Framework</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Use predefined units, observation types, and metric definitions for consistency.</li>
        <li>Support both qualitative (e.g., behavior notes) and quantitative (e.g., weight in kilograms) data.</li>
        <li>Organize data with metadata tags like Feeding, Medication, Exercise, Vital Signs, and Reproduction for easy categorization.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Subject Management</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Focus on canine subjects (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris), with extensible support for other subject types.</li>
        <li>Maintain detailed records for individual dogs, including health, behavior, and genetic profiles.</li>
    </ul>
